          Salmon River Experience first applied for our outfitters’ license in 1978 with the goal of providing the highest quality, affordable whitewater adventures available, which are both fun and adventurous while at the same time sensitive to the cultural and environmental needs of the river. SRE started with a yellow school bus, 4 used rafts and 16 life jackets. Now, over three decades later we are able to accommodate over 300 people a day with a fleet of self bailing rafts, kayaks, and support vehicles.

        <p>
       SRE guides are some of the best trained in the industry and are friendly, fun and knowledgeable professionals. We can also boast an excellent safety record as we provide comprehensive pre-trip safety talks and perform continuous gear inspections. Last year, over forty-five hundred guests joined us for an SRE adventure; over 90% of those guests were repeat customers, referrals, and their friends. Their patronage makes all of our planning and hard work very worthwhile and we sincerely appreciate their loyalty. If you are already part of our rafting family, “Thank you!” If you’re a new acquaintance, “Welcome to SALMON RIVER EXPERIENCE.”
